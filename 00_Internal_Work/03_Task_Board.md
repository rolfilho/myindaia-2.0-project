## P0 — Prep window (highest leverage; unbilled)

### Client interface & insumos — the ones that must be pushed today

| ID | Task | Owner | Feeds | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-01 | Request read access to the **export repository** | RL | CP-1 → D-a, D-d | Todo | Highest-severity dependency in the engagement. Send the moment the contract is signed; do not wait for kickoff |
| T-02 | Get client decision on OCR PoC target: **which client or which document type** | RL | DEC-01 → D-a1 | Todo | Blocks T-03. Our recommendation: pick by document type, not by client — see DEC-01 |
| T-03 | Request the **document batch with ground truth** for the chosen target | RL | CP-2 → D-a1 | Blocked | Blocked on T-02. Specify volume, format, and what "ground truth" must contain, or we'll receive PDFs with no labels |
| T-04 | Schedule the **CEO alignment session** (W1 D1–D2) | RL | CP-3 | Todo | Send the agenda and the question list ahead — see 05_Open_Questions §1 |
| T-05 | Schedule **code walkthrough with Wagner** (W1) | RL | D-a | Todo | Rodrigo attends |
| T-06 | Schedule **BROKER access session with Leandro** | RL | DEC-07 | Todo | Read-only access prerequisites are already an open blocker in MEMORY.md |
| T-07 | Send question lists to Fabricio / Wagner / Leandro **before** the clock starts | RL | all | Todo | The entire point of the prep window. Answers arriving on W1 D1 are worth far more than questions asked on W1 D1 |
| T-08 | Chase **Andrea's spreadsheet** | RL | DEC-06, D-d | Todo | Flagged in the raw notes as a key input to the delivery-cadence decision. Her role isn't in the stakeholder table — confirm who she is and what the spreadsheet contains |
| T-09 | ⭐ Request the **`BROKER` parametrization dump** (item H of A2) | RL | T-50 → D-a | Todo | **Best value-per-effort request in the engagement — send now, do not batch it with the rest of A2.** ~13 small config tables (`TSERVICO`, `TSERVICO_EVENTO`, `TEVENTO`, `TETAPA`, `TCLIENTE_SERVICO`, …). They *are* the process map, written by Indaiá themselves. Minutes of Leandro's time; not customer data; **independent of the BROKER read-access negotiation (T-06)** — do not let it get absorbed into that thread. Without it, T-50 ships a populated template instead of a populated map |

### Analysis we can do without the client

| ID | Task | Owner | Feeds | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-10 | Re-audit the **v0 migration plan** against the CEO vision and the project goals | **RL + RZ** | D-a, WS1 | Todo | The core task in the raw notes. Adjudication, not merge. **Known finding already:** the v0 plan prescribes a 2-week hard cutover + legacy decommissioning (W19–26), which the CEO's own non-negotiables rule out — see [06_Strategy_Tensions.md](06_Strategy_Tensions.md) §2. Also quantify its "~18 weeks of discarded scaffolding" claim, the strongest argument it makes and one we haven't tested. Note where the missing export codebase limits the conclusion |
| T-11 | Write the **detailed briefing for Rodrigo** | RL | WS3 | Doing | Superseded in part by this folder; the residue is the expectations + questions directed at him. See 05_Open_Questions §4 |
| T-12 | Build the **OCR PoC harness** (schema, confidence capture, HITL review surface) | RL | D-a1 | Todo | Build against synthetic/sample docs so that the day real documents arrive we only run them. See Wave 3 PoC plan |
| T-13 | High-level **IDP vendor shortlist** → pick the one provider to test | RL | DEC-01 | Todo | Starting list: LlamaParse, Reducto, Extend. Contract requires selecting **one** by high-level analysis, not benchmarking all |
| T-14 | Pre-read: CEO vision set, v0 plan, legacy audit, export README | RZ | all | Todo | Reading order in [README.md](README.md). Do **not** read raw legacy code |
| T-15 | Draft **security / LGPD remediation plan** from the existing legacy audit | RZ | D-b2 | Todo | Substantially draftable now. The `sa`/`123` hardcoded credential is a week-1 item with no negotiation per the CEO vision — verify whether it has actually been rotated |
| T-16 | Draft the **initial risk register** | RL | D-b1 | Todo | Seed from: CP-1/CP-2 exposure, Nelson's exit, team capacity, INTTRA API dependency, A3 certificate automation, single-senior-dev dependency |
| T-17 | Define the **OpEx cost taxonomy** (structure final, numbers provisional) | RL | D-c | Todo | See 02_Discovery_Plan §5 on why structure-first is the right play here |
| T-18 | Build the **kickoff validation list** (V-01…V-08) | RL | D-a, DEC-06 | Doing | [05_Open_Questions.md](05_Open_Questions.md) §1.1. Statements Fabricio confirms or corrects — foundational constraints and prioritization, not open strategy questions |
| T-19 | Run the **validation block** at the formal kickoff | RL | D-a, DEC-06, DEC-09 | Todo | Confirm constraints, get the pilot client (V-06), the most valuable milestone (V-07) and the real team composition (V-08). Hard trade-offs are explicitly **not** on this agenda — they come back qualified later (§1.3) |
| T-53 | **Get Andrea (Director of Operations) into the project** | RL | DEC-06, T-50 | Todo | ⭐ Her map of operational problems and client buckets is the missing half of the process map and the natural input to pilot-client selection. Involvement not yet confirmed |
| T-50 | **Derive the operational process map** from the legacy technical material | RL | D-a, CP-2, insumos | **Doing** | ⭐ High leverage. Plan: [Process_Map/00_Execution_Plan.md](Process_Map/00_Execution_Plan.md). **Reframed after reconnaissance: this is decode-and-render, not inference.** `BROKER` holds a parametrized workflow engine — `TSERVICO` (process catalogue, with start/end events and target cycle time), `TSERVICO_EVENTO` (ordered steps with relative SLAs), `TEVENTO` (activity dictionary incl. `CD_RESPONSAVEL` = who does what), `TETAPA` (macro-stages keyed by business unit × product), `TCLIENTE_SERVICO` (client × process matrix). The MECE spine comes from Indaiá's own dimensions; client and modal/regime are **variant overlays, not parallel branches**. Five waves: 1–3 mechanical extraction → `agy`, 4–5 synthesis + gap register → RL. Gated for completeness (not for start) on T-09 |
| T-55 | Run **waves 1–3**: schema decode, coded-rule extraction, module→process map | RL (agy) | T-50 | **Done** 2026-07-20 · outputs in [Process_Map/](Process_Map/) (~10.3k lines). **Delegation to agy largely failed** — 5 of 7 runs produced nothing (headless `mcp` permission denial, print-timeout, mid-run termination). W1, the W2 matrix, the rehydration and 12 of 48 modules were done directly in Python/grep; only `W2_coded_rules.md` and 36 modules came from agy. **Lesson: delegate reading-for-intent, never counting** — the deterministic outputs were faster to produce and are strictly more trustworthy. Verification: 98/98 routines and 332/332 SQL quotes confirmed present in source; 42/42 cited file paths resolve. ⚠️ Both agy files contain **zero** `PURPOSE UNCLEAR` / `NOT DETERMINED` across 98 routines and 36 modules — evidence is real, confidence is overstated; caveats appended to both files | W1 schema inventory from `Schema_Completo_BROKER.csv`; W2 rules from `store_procedures_BROKER.csv` + triggers, **with hardcoded literals called out separately — the exceptions are half of what the client must confirm**; W3 module participation (grep-only over the 739 MB tree) + rehydrating the six headerless CSV dumps with column headers. Run in background, Pro model for W2–W3. **Mandatory source spot-check before any of it reaches the map: a plausible fabricated business rule presented to Indaiá as "what your system does" is the worst failure mode of this exercise** |
| T-56 | Synthesise the **MECE process map + mermaid diagrams** (deliverable A) | RL | T-50, D-a, T-54 | Todo | Fixed per-process schema (trigger, inputs, outputs, stages, steps with owner+SLA, rules, exceptions, handoffs, cycle time, evidence tier). Includes the E1-vs-E2 check: does the *configured* process match what `TFOLLOWUP` shows actually firing? 200-row samples are indicative only — **no cycle-time claims from them**. The automation-coverage map is a direct input to T-54 (write-back boundary) and to the CEO's agent layer |
| T-57 | Build the **process-map gap register** and fold it into A2 / open questions (deliverable B) | RL | T-50, WS7 | Todo | Every inference, MECE violation and E0 blind spot → a numbered, addressed question. **The E0 boundary is the honest limit and gets stated to the client in those terms:** the legacy shows every step someone recorded, and nothing about the manual handoffs between them. Main respondent is Andrea (T-53), Wagner second |
| T-54 | ⭐ **Map the write-back boundary**: which agent capabilities need to write into the legacy DB, and which are read-only | RL + RZ | DEC-06, DEC-07, D-a | Todo | **Highest-value analysis in the prep window.** The v0 plan rejected strangler fig on two risks (`TFOLLOWUP` trigger cascades, dual-DB split-brain) that only bite under *bidirectional* sync. Read-only capabilities (notifications, dashboards, MQC visibility) carry neither. This map decides how much of the CEO's agent layer is genuinely cheap, and reconciles a 26-week plan with a ~100-week one. Agent 09 (booking status → `TFOLLOWUP`) is the test case. See [06_Strategy_Tensions.md](06_Strategy_Tensions.md) §2 |
| T-51 | **Research the orchestration option space** (LangGraph, n8n, alternatives) | RZ | DEC-02 | Todo | Ahead of any client contact. Independent of the missing codebase, so it costs nothing to front-load. Score candidates against **Agent 09 as the reference workload** — multi-step, external call, partial failure, escalation, audit trail |
| T-52 | Draft **Rodrigo's question list for Wagner and Indaiá** | RZ → RL | DEC-02–07, Q-20…Q-30 | Todo | So the code walkthrough (T-21) is an interrogation with a purpose rather than a tour. Merge into [05_Open_Questions.md](05_Open_Questions.md) §2 before it is sent |
